# Orbit Simulation Assignment

This Python program is a simple simulation of a planet (earth) and its moon orbiting around the sun using Pygame and OpenGL.


## Requirements
- Python 3.11.1
- Pygame
- PyOpenGL


## Setup
1. Install Python from https://python.org

2. Install required packages by running:

` pip install pygame `
` pip install PyOpenGL `


3. Run the program using Python:

` python main.py `



## Functionality
- The program displays the sun, a planet (earth, and the moon orbiting around the sun in a 3D space

- The planet (earth) revolves around the sun once every 365 "days" and the moon revolves around the planet once every 30 "days".

- Press 'V' to change the view angle to 45 degrees above the ecliptic plane and press 'V' again to revert to the default view.
